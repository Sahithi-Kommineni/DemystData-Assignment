# Fixed-Width File Parser and Anonymizer
This repository contains a Python-based tool designed to parse fixed-width files using a given "**spec.json**" file and anonymize sensitive data in CSV files. My Goal is to provide Simple easy solution yet durable with data privacy.

1. **Project Overview**

The Fixed-Width File Parser and Anonymizer is designed to handle fixed-width text files, where each column has a specified width given in **spec.json** file. It reads these files based on a configuration file that specifies the width of each column, then outputs the parsed data into a CSV file. Additionally, it includes functionality to anonymize specific fields, such as **first_name, last_name, and address**, to protect sensitive information.

2. **Features**
   
   **Flexible Parsing**: Define custom column widths using a specification file.
   
   **Data Anonymization**: Hash sensitive fields to anonymize data while maintaining its format.
   
   **Output to CSV**: Convert fixed-width files to CSV format for easier data manipulation and analysis.
   
   **Testing Suite**: Includes unit tests to verify the functionality of the parser and anonymizer.
